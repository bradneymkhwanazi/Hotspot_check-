# Hotspot_check-

This repo is about checking an area which has 5,000 hotspots in a 10x10km area. Each hotspot is at a random location in this area and is never closer than 10m from it's neighbour. Each hotspot broadcasts on one of 5 different channels which is assigned randomly initially. If a hotspot is within 350m of another hotspot and is on the same channel they will interfere.
